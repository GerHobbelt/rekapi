# Getting started with Rekapi

Although Rekapi is renderer-agnostic, it's easiest to get started by making a
simple `<canvas>` animation.  The first step is to make a new `Rekapi`
instance.  Canvas animations require a 2D `<canvas>` context to render to,
which gets passed to the `Rekapi` constructor:

````javascript
import { Rekapi, Actor } from 'rekapi';

const context = document.getElementsByTagName('canvas')[0].getContext('2d');
const rekapi = new Rekapi(context);
````

You now have a `Rekapi` instance, but it won't do anything until you define and
add some actors.

## Defining actors

Here's the boilerplate for an actor:

````javascript
const actor = new Actor({

  // Called every frame.  Receives a reference to the canvas context, and the
  // actor's state.
  render: (context, state) => {

  }

});
````

Here's a more complete example of an actor that renders a circle to the canvas:

````javascript
const actor = new Actor({
  render: (context, state) => {
    // Rekapi was given a canvas as a context, so `context` here is a
    // CanvasRenderingContext2D.

    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(
      state.x,
      state.y,
      state.radius,
      0,
      Math.PI*2,
      true
    );

    context.fillStyle = state.color;
    context.fill();
    context.closePath();
  }
});
````

The actor's `render` method can be whatever you want â€” in this case it's just
drawing a circle.  The idea is that the `context` and `state` parameters are
provided by Rekapi on every frame update, and then rendered to the `<canvas>`
by this actor's `render` method.

Now that you have an actor instance, you just need to add it to `rekapi`:

````javascript
rekapi.addActor(actor);
````

Now you can define some keyframes.

## Defining keyframes

A keyframe is a way of saying "At a given point in time, the actor should have
a particular state."  Start off by giving `actor` a starting keyframe:

````javascript
actor.keyframe(0, {
  x: 50,
  y: 50
});
````

`keyframe` is a method that takes two to three parameters - the first is which
millisecond on the animation timeline the keyframe should be placed, and the
second is an Object whose properties define the state that the actor should
have.  The optional third parameter is a string that specifies which
[Shifty](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/shifty) easing formula to use -
"linear" is the default.  The previous snippet says, "at zero milliseconds into
the animation, place `actor` at `x` 50, and `y` 50.  Continuing with that,
animate it to another point on the canvas:

````javascript
actor.keyframe(0, {
    x: 50,
    y: 50
  })
  .keyframe(1000, {
    x: 200,
    y: 100
  }, 'easeOutExpo');
````

The animation defined here will last one second, as the final `keyframe` is
set at 1000 milliseconds.  It will have a nice `easeOutExpo` ease applied to
it, as you can see in the third parameter.  Individual tweens (that is,
keyframed animation segments) get their easing curves from the keyframe they
are animating to, not animating from.

Rekapi inherits all of [Shifty's easing
functions](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/shifty/blob/master/src/easing-functions.js).

## Playing the animation

So now you've set up a sweet animation - run it and see what it looks like:

````javascript
rekapi.play();
````

And the animation will just loop continuously.  You can also pass a `number` to
`play()` to define how many times to play before stopping, like so:

````javascript
rekapi.play(3);
````

This will play the animation three times and stop.  When an animation stops, it
will just sit at the last frame that was rendered.  You can control the
animation playback with `rekapi.pause()` and `rekapi.stop()`.
